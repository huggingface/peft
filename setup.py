# Release checklist
# 1. Change the version in __init__.py and setup.py to the release version, e.g. from "0.6.0.dev0" to "0.6.0"
# 2. Check if there are any deprecations that need to be addressed for this release by seaching for "# TODO" in the code
# 3. Commit these changes with the message: "Release: VERSION", create a PR and merge it.
# 4. Add a tag in git to mark the release: "git tag -a VERSION -m 'Adds tag VERSION for pypi' "
#    Push the tag to git:
#      git push --tags origin main
#    It is necessary to work on the original repository, not on a fork.
# 5. Run the following commands in the top-level directory:
#      python setup.py bdist_wheel
#      python setup.py sdist
#    Ensure that you are on the clean and up-to-date main branch (git status --untracked-files=no should not list any
#    files and show the main branch)
# 6. Upload the package to the pypi test server first:
#      twine upload dist/* -r pypitest
# 7. Check that you can install it in a virtualenv by running:
#      pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple peft
# 8. Upload the final version to actual pypi:
#      twine upload dist/* -r pypi
# 9. Add release notes to the tag on https://github.com/huggingface/peft/releases once everything is looking hunky-dory.
#      Check the notes here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k-sOIfykuKjWcOIALqjhFKz4amFEp-myeJUJEzNgjoU/edit?usp=sharing
# 10. Update the version in __init__.py, setup.py to the bumped minor version + ".dev0" (e.g. from "0.6.0" to "0.7.0.dev0")
