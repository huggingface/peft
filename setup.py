# Release checklist
# 1. Change the version in __init__.py and setup.py.
# 2. Commit these changes with the message: "Release: VERSION"
# 3. Add a tag in git to mark the release: "git tag VERSION -m 'Adds tag VERSION for pypi' "
#    Push the tag to git: git push --tags origin main
# 4. Run the following commands in the top-level directory:
#      python setup.py bdist_wheel
#      python setup.py sdist
# 5. Upload the package to the pypi test server first:
#      twine upload dist/* -r pypitest
#      twine upload dist/* -r pypitest --repository-url=https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
# 6. Check that you can install it in a virtualenv by running:
#      pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi peft
# 7. Upload the final version to actual pypi:
#      twine upload dist/* -r pypi
# 8. Add release notes to the tag in github once everything is looking hunky-dory.
# 9. Update the version in __init__.py, setup.py to the new version "-dev" and push to master
