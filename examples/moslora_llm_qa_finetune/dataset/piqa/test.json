        "instruction": "Please choose the correct solution to the question: Make the best tasting lemonade you've ever tried.\n\nSolution1: Only use fresh lemons, a dozen for a 2 litre pitcher is perfect. Use only filtered water, no chlorine etc. Using a lemon squeezer or juicer, extract the fresh juice and pour into your 2 litre pitcher along with your favorite sweetener to taste, and fill with pure water. The water is what makes this lemonade taste so good. No after taste or chemical flavours to spoil it.\n\nSolution2: Lemonade can be made using vinegar and sugar, if you run out of lemons. With enough sugar you can't really taste the difference. It might need some yellow food colouring to make it look \"lemony\", which is quite important because the visual impact of food can rival the impact of the taste of the food itself.\n\nAnswer format: solution1/solution2",

At least one person will know how to do it right, so they will all eventually figure it out.\n\nSolution2: Invite 10 or 12 kids over half an hour before the party starts. With them watching, blow up a couple of balloons but tell the kids  they aren't allowed to touch them. Then, leave a box of pins on the table and say \"and don't touch these either\" very clearly. Leave the room until you hear the popping sounds.  When you come back in, tell them if they want balloons at the party they're the ones who have to blow them up.
