		"sQuestion": "A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?",

		"rationale": "Explanation :\nLet the height of the building be h. Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).\nNow, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.\ntan 60 = h/x x = h/\u221a3\nSo, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h \u2013 x = h - h/\u221a3.\n10 minutes = h *( 1 \u2013 1\u221a3)\nh can be travelled in 10 / (1 \u2013 1\u221a3).\nTo travel a distance of x, which is h/\u221a3, it takes :\nh = 10 / (1 \u2013 1/\u221a3)\nh / \u221a3 = 10/ \u221a3 * (1 \u2013 1/\u221a3). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + \u221a3 ( conjugate of 1 - \u221a3). We get, x = h/\u221a3 = 10 (1 + \u221a3) / 2 = 5* (1 + \u221a3)\nSo, it takes 5(1 + \u221a3) minutes to reach the base of the tower.\nAnswer : A",
