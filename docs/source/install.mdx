# Installation

Before you start, you will need to setup your environment, install the appropriate packages, and configure ðŸ¤— PEFT. ðŸ¤— PEFT is tested on **Python 3.7+**.

ðŸ¤— PEFT is available on pypi, as well as GitHub:

## pip 

To install ðŸ¤— PEFT from pypi:

```bash
pip install peft
```

## Source

New features that haven't been released yet are added every day, which also means there may be some bugs. To try them out, install from the GitHub repository:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/peft
```

If you're working on contributing to the library or wish to play with the source code and see live 
results as you run the code, an editable version can be installed from a locally-cloned version of the 
repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/peft
cd peft
pip install -e .
```
