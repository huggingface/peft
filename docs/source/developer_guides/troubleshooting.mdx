# Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issue when using PEFT, please check the following list of common issues and their solutions.

## Examples don't work

Examples often rely on the most recent package versions, so please ensure they're up-to-date. In particular, check the version of the following packages:

- `peft`
- `transformers`
- `accelerate`
- `torch`

In general, you can update the package version by running this command inside your Python environment:

```bash
python -m pip install -U <package_name>
```

Installing PEFT from source is useful for keeping up with the latest developments:

```bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/peft
```

## Bad results from a loaded PEFT model

There can be several reasons for getting a poor result from a loaded PEFT model, which are listed below. If you're still unable to troubleshoot the problem, see if anyone else had a similar [issue](https://github.com/huggingface/peft/issues) on GitHub, and if you can't find any, open a new issue.

When opening an issue, it helps a lot if you provide a minimal code example that reproduces the issue. Also, please report if the loaded model performs at the same level as the model did before fine-tuning, if it performs at a random level, or if it is only slightly worse than expected. This information helps us identify the problem more quickly.

### Random deviations

If your model outputs are not exactly the same as previous runs, there could be an issue with random elements. For example:

1. please ensure it is in `.eval()` mode, which is important, for instance, if the model uses dropout
2. if you use [`~transformers.GenerationMixin.generate`] on a language model, there could be random sampling, so obtaining the same result requires setting a random seed
3. if you used quantization and merged the weights, small deviations are expected due to rounding errors

### Incorrectly loaded model

Please ensure that you load the model correctly. A common error is trying to load a _trained_ model with `get_peft_model`, which is incorrect. Instead, the loading code should look like this:

```python
from peft import PeftModel, PeftConfig

base_model = ...  # to load the base model, use the same code as when you trained it
config = PeftConfig.from_pretrained(peft_model_id)
peft_model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(base_model, peft_model_id)
```

### Randomly initialized layers

For some tasks, it is important to correctly configure `modules_to_save` in the config to account for randomly initialized layers. 

As an example, this is necessary if you use LoRA to fine-tune a language model for sequence classification because ðŸ¤— Transformers adds a randomly initialized classification head on top of the model. If you do not add this layer to `modules_to_save`, the classification head won't be saved. The next time you load the model, you'll get a _different_ randomly initialized classification head, resulting in completely different results.

In PEFT, we try to correctly guess the `modules_to_save` if you provide the `task_type` argument in the config. This should work for transformers models that follow the standard naming scheme. It is always a good idea to double check though because we can't guarantee all models follow the naming scheme.

When you load a transformers model that has randomly initialized layers, you should see a warning along the lines of:

```
Some weights of <MODEL> were not initialized from the model checkpoint at <ID> and are newly initialized: [<LAYER_NAMES>].
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
```

The mentioned layers should be added to `modules_to_save` in the config to avoid the described problem.
