# PEFT

ðŸ¤— PEFT, or Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), is a library for efficiently adapting pre-trained language models (PLMs) to various downstream applications without fine-tuning all the model's parameters. 
PEFT methods only fine-tune a small number of (extra) model parameters, significantly decreasing computational and storage costs because fine-tuning large-scale PLMs is prohibitively costly.
Recent state-of-the-art PEFT techniques achieve performance comparable to that of full fine-tuning.

PEFT is seamlessly integrated with ðŸ¤— Accelerate for large-scale models leveraging DeepSpeed and [Big Model Inference](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/usage_guides/big_modeling). 

Supported methods include:

1. LoRA: [LORA: LOW-RANK ADAPTATION OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09685.pdf)
2. Prefix Tuning: [Prefix-Tuning: Optimizing Continuous Prompts for Generation](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.353/), [P-Tuning v2: Prompt Tuning Can Be Comparable to Fine-tuning Universally Across Scales and Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.07602.pdf)
3. P-Tuning: [GPT Understands, Too](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.10385.pdf)
4. Prompt Tuning: [The Power of Scale for Parameter-Efficient Prompt Tuning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08691.pdf)
