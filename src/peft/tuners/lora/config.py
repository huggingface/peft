    This is the sub-configuration class to store the configuration for a data-driven initialization via EVA. EVA was
    introduced in <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07170'>Explained Variance Adaptation</a>.

    Args:
        rho (`float`):
            Rho value for EVA redistribution (>= 1.0). The maximum rank for a layer is lora_r * rho. Default is 2.0,
            meaning the maximum rank allowed for a layer is 2r. Increasing rho will allow for a higher degree of
            redistribution of ranks across layers. Some pre-trained models might be more sensitive to a rank
            redistribution. It can therefore be beneficial to try rho=1.0 (no redistribution) if the performance is
            lower than expected.
        tau (`float`):
            Cosine similarity threshold for early stopping. Compares the cosine similarity of right-singular vectors
            between two consecutive SVD steps. If the cosine similarity is above this threshold, the SVD iteration is
            stopped. Default is 0.99.
        use_label_mask (`bool`):
            Use label mask for EVA initialization. This means that positions where labels=label_mask_value are ignored
            for the SVD computation. Setting use_label_mask=True is preferred in most cases and can be especially
            beneficial for multi-turn conversations. The default value is True. Filtering out items based on the label
            mask can sometimes lead to a small batch size and as a result instabilities in the SVD computation. For
            cases where a large share of batch items would be filtered out, set use_label_mask=False.
        label_mask_value (`int`):
            If use_label_mask=True the value to look for to mask out ignored tokens. Default is -100.
        whiten (`bool`): Apply whitening to singular vectors. Default is False.
            Whitening has been shown to be beneficial for EVA in the vision domain.
        adjust_scaling_factors (`bool`):
            Adjust LoRA scaling factors after the rank redistribution. Setting this to True means the scaling factors
            are adjusted so that all LoRA gradients have the same scale regardless of their rank. Default is True.

@dataclass
class LoraConfig(PeftConfig):
    """
    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`LoraModel`].

    Args:
        r (`int`):
            Lora attention dimension (the "rank").
        target_modules (`Optional[Union[List[str], str]]`):
            The names of the modules to apply the adapter to. If this is specified, only the modules with the specified
            names will be replaced. When passing a string, a regex match will be performed. When passing a list of
            strings, either an exact match will be performed or it is checked if the name of the module ends with any
            of the passed strings. If this is specified as 'all-linear', then all linear/Conv1D modules are chosen (if
            the model is a PreTrainedModel, the output layer excluded). If this is not specified, modules will be
            chosen according to the model architecture. If the architecture is not known, an error will be raised -- in
            this case, you should specify the target modules manually.
        exclude_modules (`Optional[Union[List[str], str]]`):
            The names of the modules to not apply the adapter. When passing a string, a regex match will be performed.
            When passing a list of strings, either an exact match will be performed or it is checked if the name of the
            module ends with any of the passed strings.
        lora_alpha (`int`):
            The alpha parameter for Lora scaling.
        lora_dropout (`float`):
            The dropout probability for Lora layers.
        fan_in_fan_out (`bool`):
            Set this to True if the layer to replace stores weight like (fan_in, fan_out). For example, gpt-2 uses
            `Conv1D` which stores weights like (fan_in, fan_out) and hence this should be set to `True`.
        bias (`str`):
            Bias type for LoRA. Can be 'none', 'all' or 'lora_only'. If 'all' or 'lora_only', the corresponding biases
            will be updated during training. Be aware that this means that, even when disabling the adapters, the model
            will not produce the same output as the base model would have without adaptation.
        use_rslora (`bool`):
            When set to True, uses <a href='https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2312.03732'>Rank-Stabilized LoRA</a> which
            sets the adapter scaling factor to `lora_alpha/math.sqrt(r)`, since it was proven to work better.
            Otherwise, it will use the original default value of `lora_alpha/r`.
        modules_to_save (`List[str]`):
            List of modules apart from adapter layers to be set as trainable and saved in the final checkpoint.
        init_lora_weights (`bool` | `Literal["gaussian", "eva", "olora", "pissa", "pissa_niter_[number of iters]", "corda", "loftq"]`):
            How to initialize the weights of the adapter layers. Passing True (default) results in the default
            initialization from the reference implementation from Microsoft. Passing 'gaussian' results in Gaussian
            initialization scaled by the LoRA rank for linear and layers. Setting the initialization to False leads to
            completely random initialization and is discouraged. Pass `'loftq'` to use LoftQ initialization. Passing
            `'eva'` results in a data-driven initialization of <ahref='https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07170' >Explained
            Variance Adaptation</a>. EVA initalizes LoRA based on the SVD of layer input activations and achieves SOTA
            performance due to its ability to adapt to the finetuning data. Pass `'olora'` to use OLoRA initialization.
            Passing `'pissa'` results in the initialization of <ahref='https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02948' >Principal
            Singular values and Singular vectors Adaptation (PiSSA)</a>, which converges more rapidly than LoRA and
            ultimately achieves superior performance. Moreover, PiSSA reduces the quantization error compared to QLoRA,
            leading to further enhancements. Passing `'pissa_niter_[number of iters]'` initiates Fast-SVD-based PiSSA
            initialization, where `[number of iters]` indicates the number of subspace iterations to perform FSVD, and
            must be a nonnegative integer. When `[number of iters]` is set to 16, it can complete the initialization of
            a 7B model within seconds, and the training effect is approximately equivalent to using SVD. Passing
            `'corda'` results in the initialization of <ahref='https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05223' >Context-Oriented
            Decomposition Adaptation</a>, which converges even more rapidly than PiSSA in Instruction-Previewed Mode,
            and preserves world knowledge better than LoRA in Knowledge-Preserved Mode.
        layers_to_transform (`Union[List[int], int]`):
            The layer indices to transform. If a list of ints is passed, it will apply the adapter to the layer indices
            that are specified in this list. If a single integer is passed, it will apply the transformations on the
            layer at this index.
        layers_pattern (`Optional[Union[List[str], str]]`):
            The layer pattern name, used only if `layers_to_transform` is different from `None`. This should target the
            `nn.ModuleList` of the model, which is often called `'layers'` or `'h'`.
        rank_pattern (`dict`):
            The mapping from layer names or regexp expression to ranks which are different from the default rank
            specified by `r`.
        alpha_pattern (`dict`):
            The mapping from layer names or regexp expression to alphas which are different from the default alpha
            specified by `lora_alpha`.
        megatron_config (`Optional[dict]`):
            The TransformerConfig arguments for Megatron. It is used to create LoRA's parallel linear layer. You can
            get it like this, `core_transformer_config_from_args(get_args())`, these two functions being from Megatron.
            The arguments will be used to initialize the TransformerConfig of Megatron. You need to specify this
            parameter when you want to apply LoRA to the ColumnParallelLinear and RowParallelLinear layers of megatron.
        megatron_core (`Optional[str]`):
            The core module from Megatron to use, defaults to `"megatron.core"`.
        loftq_config (`Optional[LoftQConfig]`):
            The configuration of LoftQ. If this is not None, then LoftQ will be used to quantize the backbone weights
            and initialize Lora layers. Also pass `init_lora_weights='loftq'`. Note that you should not pass a
            quantized model in this case, as LoftQ will quantize the model itself.
        eva_config (`Optional[EvaConfig]`):
            The configuration of EVA. At a minimum the dataset argument needs to be set (use the same dataset as for
            finetuning).
        corda_config (`Optional[CordaConfig]`):
            The configuration of CorDA. If this is not None, then CorDA will be used to build the adapter layers. Also
            pass `init_lora_weights='corda'`.
        use_dora (`bool`):
            Enable 'Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation' (DoRA). This technique decomposes the updates of the weights
            into two parts, magnitude and direction. Direction is handled by normal LoRA, whereas the magnitude is
            handled by a separate learnable parameter. This can improve the performance of LoRA especially at low
            ranks. Right now, DoRA only supports linear and Conv2D layers. DoRA introduces a bigger overhead than pure
            LoRA, so it is recommended to merge weights for inference. For more information, see
            https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09353.
        layer_replication (`List[Tuple[int, int]]`):
            Build a new stack of layers by stacking the original model layers according to the ranges specified. This
            allows expanding (or shrinking) the model without duplicating the base model weights. The new layers will
            all have separate LoRA adapters attached to them.
        runtime_config (`LoraRuntimeConfig`):
            Runtime configurations (which are not saved or restored).
        lora_bias (`bool`):
            Defaults to `False`. Whether to enable the bias term for the LoRA B parameter. Typically, this should be
            disabled. The main use case for this is when the LoRA weights were extracted from fully fine-tuned
            parameters so the bias of those parameters can be taken into account.
