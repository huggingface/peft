@dataclass
class OFTConfig(PeftConfig):
    """
    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`OFTModel`].

    Args:
        r (`int`): OFT rank, number of OFT blocks per injected layer.
        oft_block_size (`int`): OFT block size across different layers.
        module_dropout (`float`):
            The multiplicative dropout probability, by setting OFT blocks to identity during training, similar to the
            dropout layer in LoRA.
        target_modules (`Optional[Union[list[str], str]]`):
            The names of the modules to apply the adapter to. If this is specified, only the modules with the specified
            names will be replaced. When passing a string, a regex match will be performed. When passing a list of
            strings, either an exact match will be performed or it is checked if the name of the module ends with any
            of the passed strings. If this is specified as 'all-linear', then all linear modules are chosen, excluding
            the output layer. If this is not specified, modules will be chosen according to the model architecture. If
            the architecture is not known, an error will be raised -- in this case, you should specify the target
            modules manually.
        fan_in_fan_out (`bool`): Set this to True if the layer to replace stores weight like (fan_in, fan_out).
        bias (`str`): Bias type for OFT. Can be 'none', 'all' or 'oft_only'. If 'all' or 'oft_only', the
            corresponding biases will be updated during training. Be aware that this means that, even when disabling
            the adapters, the model will not produce the same output as the base model would have without adaptation.
        exclude_modules (`Optional[Union[List[str], str]]`):
            The names of the modules to not apply the adapter. When passing a string, a regex match will be performed.
            When passing a list of strings, either an exact match will be performed or it is checked if the name of the
            module ends with any of the passed strings.
        init_weights (`bool`):
            Whether to perform initialization of OFT weights.
        layers_to_transform (`Union[List[int], int]`):
            The layer indices to transform. If a list of ints is passed, it will apply the adapter to the layer indices
            that are specified in this list. If a single integer is passed, it will apply the transformations on the
            layer at this index.
        layers_pattern (`Optional[Union[List[str], str]]`):
            The layer pattern name, used only if `layers_to_transform` is different from `None`. This should target the
            `nn.ModuleList` of the model, which is often called `'layers'` or `'h'`.
        rank_pattern (`dict`):
            The mapping from layer names or regexp expression to ranks which are different from the default rank
            specified by `r`.
        modules_to_save (`List[str]`):
            List of modules apart from adapter layers to be set as trainable and saved in the final checkpoint.
        coft (`bool`):
            Whether to use the constrained variant of OFT or not, off by default.
        eps (`float`):
            The control strength of COFT. The freedom of rotation. Only has an effect if `coft` is set to True.
        block_share (`bool`):
            Whether to share the OFT parameters between blocks or not. This is `False` by default.
