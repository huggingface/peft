@dataclass
class DeloraConfig(PeftConfig):
    """
    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`DeloraModel`].

    Args:
        r (`int`):
            The rank of the DeLoRA adapter.
        lambda_ (`int`):
            The initial value of the boundary of the DeLoRA adapter. This variable sets an upper bound to the Frobenius
            norm of the weight change, avoiding the finetuned model to deviate too much from the original model.
        module_dropout (`float`):
            The dropout probability for disabling DeLoRA modules during training.
        target_modules (`Optional[Union[List[str], str]]`):
            The names of the modules to apply the adapter to. If this is specified, only the modules with the specified
            names will be replaced. When passing a string, a regex match will be performed. When passing a list of
            strings, either an exact match will be performed or it is checked if the name of the module ends with any
            of the passed strings. If this is specified as 'all-linear', then all linear/Conv1D modules are chosen,
            excluding the output layer. If this is not specified, modules will be chosen according to the model
            architecture. If the architecture is not known, an error will be raised -- in this case, you should specify
            the target modules manually.
        exclude_modules (`Optional[Union[List[str], str]]`):
            The names of the modules to not apply the adapter. When passing a string, a regex match will be performed.
            When passing a list of strings, either an exact match will be performed or it is checked if the name of the
            module ends with any of the passed strings.
        bias (`str`):
            Bias type for DeLoRA. Can be 'none', 'all' or 'delora_only'. If 'all' or 'delora_only', the corresponding biases
            will be updated during training. Be aware that this means that, even when disabling the adapters, the model
            will not produce the same output as the base model would have without adaptation.
        init_weights (`bool`):
            Whether to perform initialization of adapter weights. If `True` (default): adapters are initialized
            in an identity-preserving way with kaiming uniform initialization. If `False`: adapters immediately
            contribute a non-zero delta and force `use_residual_init=False` with no initial A and B buffers.
            This is generally discouraged for normal use.
        use_residual_init (`bool`):
            If False, frozen initial copies of the adapters are subtracted in the forward pass to allow for identity
            initialization. This requires storing extra buffers on device, and extra computation. If `True`, initial
            adapters are subtracted from the base weights once after initialization, so the effective initial delta is zero
            without storing extra buffers on device.
        layers_to_transform (`Union[List[int], int]`):
            The layer indices to transform. If a list of ints is passed, it will apply the adapter to the layer indices
            that are specified in this list. If a single integer is passed, it will apply the transformations on the
            layer at this index.
        layers_pattern (`Optional[Union[List[str], str]]`):
            The layer pattern name, used only if `layers_to_transform` is different from `None`. This should target the
            `nn.ModuleList` of the model, which is often called `'layers'` or `'h'`.
        rank_pattern (`dict`):
            The mapping from layer names or regexp expression to ranks which are different from the default rank
            specified by `r`. For example, `{'^model.decoder.layers.0.encoder_attn.k_proj': 16}`.
        lambda_pattern (`dict`):
            The mapping from layer names or regexp expression to lambdas which are different from the default lambda
            specified by `lambda_`. For example, `{'^model.decoder.layers.0.encoder_attn.k_proj': 16}`.
        modules_to_save (`Optional[List[str]]`):
            List of modules apart from adapter layers to be set as trainable and saved in the final checkpoint.
