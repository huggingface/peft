class WeightLoraConfig(LoraConfig):
    """
    Configuration class of [`WeightLoraModel`].

    Args:
        r (`int`):
            Lora rank.
        lora_alpha (`int`):
            The alpha parameter for Lora scaling.
        rank_dropout (`float`):
            The dropout probability for rank dimension during training.
        module_dropout (`float`):
            The dropout probability for disabling Lora modules during training.
        target_modules (`Optional[Union[List[str], str]]`):
            The names of the modules to apply the adapter to. If this is specified, only the modules with the specified
            names will be replaced. When passing a string, a regex match will be performed. When passing a list of
            strings, either an exact match will be performed or it is checked if the name of the module ends with any
            of the passed strings. If this is specified as 'all-linear', then all linear modules are chosen,
            excluding the output layer. If this is not specified, modules will be chosen according to the model
            architecture. If the architecture is not known, an error will be raised -- in this case, you should specify
            the target modules manually.
        init_weights (`bool`):
            Whether to perform initialization of adapter weights. This defaults to `True`, passing `False` is
            discouraged.
        layers_to_transform (`Union[List[int], int]`):
            The layer indices to transform. If a list of ints is passed, it will apply the adapter to the layer indices
            that are specified in this list. If a single integer is passed, it will apply the transformations on the
            layer at this index.
        layers_pattern (`str`):
            The layer pattern name, used only if `layers_to_transform` is different from `None`.
        rank_pattern (`dict`):
            The mapping from layer names or regexp expression to ranks which are different from the default rank
            specified by `r`.
        alpha_pattern (`dict`):
            The mapping from layer names or regexp expression to alphas which are different from the default alpha
            specified by `alpha`.
        modules_to_save (`Optional[List[str]]`):
            List of modules apart from adapter layers to be set as trainable and saved in the final checkpoint.
