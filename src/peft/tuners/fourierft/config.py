@dataclass
class FourierFTConfig(PeftConfig):
    """
    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`FourierFTModel`].

    Args:
        n_frequency (`int`):
            Num of learnable frequencies for the Discrete Fourier Transform. 'n_frequency' is an integer that is
            greater than 0 and less than or equal to d^2 (assuming the weight W has dimensions of d by d).
            Additionally, it is the number of trainable parameters required to update each delta W weight.
            'n_frequency' will affect the performance and efficiency for PEFT. Specifically, it has little impact on
            training speed, but higher values of it (typically) result in larger GPU memory costs and better accuracy.
            With the same `target_modules`, the number of parameters of LoRA is (2*d*r/n_frequency) times that of
            FourierFT. The following examples of settings regarding 'n_frequency' can be used as reference for users.
            For NLU tasks with the RoBERTa-large model, adopting 'n_frequency': 1000 can almost achieve similar results
            as 'r': 8 in LoRA. At this time, the number of parameters of LoRA is about 16 times that of FourierFT. For
            image classification tasks with Vit-large models, adopting 'n_frequency': 3000 can almost achieve similar
            results as 'r': 16 in LoRA, where the number of parameters of LoRA is about 11 times that of FourierFT.
        scaling (`float`):
            The scaling value for the delta W matrix. This is an important hyperparameter used for scaling, similar to
            the 'lora_alpha' parameter in the LoRA method. 'scaling' can be determined during the hyperparameter search
            process. However, if users want to skip this process, one can refer to the settings in the following
            scenarios. This parameter can be set to 100.0 or 150.0 for both RoBERTa-base and RoBERTa-large models
            across all NLU (GLUE) tasks. This parameter can be set to 300.0 for both LLaMA family models for all
            instruction tuning. This parameter can be set to 300.0 for both ViT-base and ViT-large models across all
            image classification tasks.
        random_loc_seed (`int`):
            Seed for the random location of the frequencies, i.e., the spectral entry matrix.
        target_modules (`Union[list[str],str]`):
            List of module names or regex expression of the module names to replace with FourierFT. For example, ['q',
            'v'] or '.*decoder.*(SelfAttention|EncDecAttention).*(q|v)$'. Only linear layers are supported.
        exclude_modules (`Optional[Union[List[str], str]]`):
            The names of the modules to not apply the adapter. When passing a string, a regex match will be performed.
            When passing a list of strings, either an exact match will be performed or it is checked if the name of the
            module ends with any of the passed strings.
        fan_in_fan_out (`bool`):
            Set this to True if the layer to replace stores weight like (fan_in, fan_out).
        bias (`str`):
            Bias type for FourierFT. Can be 'none', 'all' or 'fourier_only'.
        modules_to_save (`list[str]`):
            List of modules apart from FourierFT layers to be set as trainable and saved in the final checkpoint. For
            example, in Sequence Classification or Token Classification tasks, the final layer `classifier/score` are
            randomly initialized and as such need to be trainable and saved.
        layers_to_transform (`Union[list[int],int]`):
            The layer indexes to transform, is this argument is specified, PEFT will transform only the layers indexes
            that are specified inside this list. If a single integer is passed, PEFT will transform only the layer at
            this index.
        layers_pattern (`str`):
            The layer pattern name, used only if `layers_to_transform` is different to None and if the layer pattern is
            not in the common layers pattern.
        n_frequency_pattern (`dict`):
            The mapping from layer names or regexp expression to n_frequency which are different from the default
            specified. For example, `{model.decoder.layers.0.encoder_attn.k_proj: 1000`}.
        init_weights (`bool`):
            The initialization of the Fourier weights. Set this to False if the spectrum are initialized to a standard
            normal distribution. Set this to True if the spectrum are initialized to zeros.
